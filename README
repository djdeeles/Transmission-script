This project contains a bash script for Transmission bittorrent client.

The script created will set the network limits according to the number of
clients in the network so is very useful for those headless transmission clients
running on a home-lan server. When the server is the only host in the network
the limits will be set to 0 (no-limit) and therefore the bittorrent client will
be transmiting as it max rates.

In the other hand, when any other host is using the network, the script will
detect it and will lower those limits in order to not overload the network.

The script is suppossed to be run periodically, every few minutes (2-3) so it
should be combined with a schedule tool like cron.
